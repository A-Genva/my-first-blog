# Project-Sparks2Fire

There are a large number of individuals and organizations that are doing extremely good work in addressing various social issues in the country. The general public remains largely unaware of such efforts as it never gets attention from the popular media. There needs to be some effort towards making the masses aware about the excellent efforts made by certain individuals who are otherwise no different than the rest and also by organizations which are doing work for the benefit of the underprivileged in the country. Knowledge of such efforts and suggestion of ways in which any citizen can contribute whether from their homes or otherwise can potentially scale up the efforts. The proposed work is aimed at building web based tools (website) for addressing the above.
